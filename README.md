# Eco-Choice
Many farmers have to rely on intermediaries to sell their products, resulting in reduced profits. 
The absence of direct sales channels also hinders farmers' ability to establish relationships with 
customers and market their products effectively. The primary objective of our project is to 
provide an independent platform for farmers to sell their organic products online. Farmers can 
add different products they want to sell and view customers order. Customers can view 
products available from different farmers, add them in a cart and place a purchase order. It
provides a seamless experience for customers to purchase authenticated organic products.
